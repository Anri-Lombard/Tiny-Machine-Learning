# TinyML

## Description

Notes on the HarvardX TinyML course on EdX.

## Approach to this Repository

This repository documents the essential concepts for review and deeper understanding. It is the skelenton of the course, which I find is the most important part to grasp. Some notebooks are included for exploration and experimentation.

## Structure of Certification

1. Fundamentals of TinyML
2. Applications of TinyML
3. Deploying TinyML
